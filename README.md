# Repo Lovense Lush Controller
This has been something I've wanted to do for a while. I finally got around to it. This plugin allows you to control a Lovense Lush vibrator from REPO. This was just a dumb little project I wanted to make because well I thought it was hysterical. This currently only supports things that go bzzbzz (Lush 4 was the only one tested), and only one device can be connected at a time.



# Known Bugs
- Queue system bugs out a little when using the grab vibrate
- Sometimes when using the grab vibrate it will just stop vibrating if you bump something.

# Requirements
- A Lovense Lush (Lush 4, others may work never tried others lol)
- REPO (Obviously)
- A Windows PC (I'd hope)
- Bluetooth (Obviously)
- [BepinEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.23.3/BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.3.zip)

# Installation
- Download and copy bepinex to your REPO folder
- Download [LovenseBLE_lib.dll](https://developer.lovense.com/LovenseBLE_Lib.dll) and copy to your REPO/BepinEx/plugins folder
- Download the latest release of this plugin and copy the .dll to your REPO/BepinEx/plugins folder
- You will then be greeted by this in the top left of your screen when you start REPO
